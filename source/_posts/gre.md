我的GRE备考从8.21正式开始，8.28首考(成绩未提交)，预计于9月底完成，目标155+170W3.5，总过程历时一个月半。本文阐述了在我的GRE备考过程中，提炼出的矛盾与方法论的汇总。

My GRE preparation started from 8.21, and the first test was 8.28 (scores not submitted). It is expected to be completed by the end of September. The goal is 155+170W3.5. The total process lasts one and a half months. This article explains the contradictions and methodologies that were extracted during my GRE preparation process.

## 备考定位
我备考GRE的主要目的是，借助GRE的备考过程，有效提升英语词汇量与论文阅读水平(速度)。于此同时，此次备考过程也将成为Tomato Proj的有效试验，为今后实现有序和谐的生活节奏提供经验参考。此外，申请一些美国学校则也需要提供GRE成绩。

## 备考矛盾分析

### 时间不足
由于暑假投入大量时间，准备申研材料，学习积累专业知识，准备FYP，我只留下了1个月左右的时间准备GRE。因此，时间不足的问题需要由方法论的精进来弥补。

## 数学矛盾分析

### 跳过机制
GRE数学的关键对于我们经理过理科高考的人来说，通过一定量的练习回顾，将期望调节到170左右，是比较轻松的。但是这并不意味着就可以对GRE数学掉以轻心。在备考GRE数学时，除了提高期望外，更加重要的是如何缩小方差。考虑到GRE数学在设计上时间较为紧张，只有35分钟，而且有可能会遇到一些很难的题，或者看不懂的题，这时就要果断跳过，及时止损。因此，在数学的备考过程中，需要**形成一套判断是否跳过的判断机制，且判断耗时越少越好**。

### 题型解析机制
在数学的备考过程中，除了减小方差，也要有效提高期望。与高考不同的是，GRE数学的语言是英语，且还有一系列的逻辑陷阱。因此，要提高GRE数学的期望，需要对以下三点进行"程序化"处理，提炼出相应方法论。
 - 数学常用英语
 - 各种题型解题方法套路
 - 选择方法的方法


### 查错机制
尽管GRE数学的考试时间是否有限，但并不排除有时间会剩下的可能性。因此，可以注意锻炼一套有利于利用剩余时间差错的机制。比如，合理规划使用演草纸等。

## 阅读矛盾分析

### 一遍读懂
通过这几天的训练，我发现了一个现象，及如果最开始看文章没有看懂，那么后面做题基本靠蒙。因此，GRE阅读一定要先将文章看懂。要实现这一点，可以通过提炼句子的s3版本，通过居间关系连接词对下一句内容进行预判，以此递归。

### 提高速度
在有限的时间内把文章看懂。。


## 填空矛盾分析

### 词汇量
先把3000刷熟，再把托福词汇刷过。。然后再看看。刷单词时一定要批量(比如以500词为一组)，多变。一天过好几遍，闪现就行，几天后就会见效。

### 公式化处理
把题目抽象成公式处理。。

## Test preparation positioning
My main purpose of preparing for the GRE is to effectively improve my English vocabulary and paper reading level (speed) with the help of the GRE preparation process. At the same time, this test preparation process will also become an effective test of Tomato Proj, providing an experience reference for the realization of an orderly and harmonious life rhythm in the future. In addition, GRE scores are also required to apply to some American schools.

## Test preparation contradiction analysis

### deficiency of time
Since I invested a lot of time during the summer vacation, preparing application materials, learning and accumulating professional knowledge, and preparing for FYP, I only left about 1 month to prepare for GRE. Therefore, the problem of insufficient time needs to be compensated by methodological refinement.

## Mathematical contradiction analysis

### Skip mechanism
The key to GRE mathematics is relatively easy for our managers who have passed the science college entrance examination to adjust their expectations to about 170 through a certain amount of exercise review. But this does not mean that GRE math can be taken lightly. When preparing for the GRE math test, in addition to raising expectations, it is more important to reduce variance. Considering that GRE mathematics is relatively tight in design time, only 35 minutes, and there may be some difficult or unintelligible questions, then you must skip it decisively and stop the loss in time. Therefore, in the preparation process of mathematics, it is necessary to form a judging mechanism for judging whether to skip, and the less time-consuming judgment, the better.

### Question type analysis mechanism
In the preparation process of mathematics, in addition to reducing variance, we must also effectively raise expectations. Unlike the college entrance examination, the language of GRE math is English, and there are a series of logical traps. Therefore, in order to increase the expectation of GRE mathematics, the following three points need to be "programmed" to refine the corresponding methodology.
 - Common English for Mathematics
 - Various problem solving methods
 - Method of choosing method


### Error checking mechanism
Although the time for the GRE math test is limited, it does not rule out the possibility that time will be left. Therefore, you can pay attention to exercise a set of mechanisms that are conducive to using the remaining time error. For example, rationally plan the use of cursive paper.

## Reading contradiction analysis

### Read it again
Through the training of the past few days, I have discovered a phenomenon, and if I did not understand the article at the beginning, then I basically rely on misunderstanding to do the questions later. Therefore, GRE reading must first understand the article. To achieve this, the s3 version of the sentence can be refined, and the content of the next sentence can be pre-judged through the intermediate relational connectives, so as to recurse.

### accelerate
Read the article in a limited time. .

### Vocabulary
First brush 3000, and then brush the TOEFL vocabulary. . Then look again. When scanning words, be sure to batch (for example, 500 words as a group), changeable. Pass it several times a day, just flash, and it will be effective in a few days.
