## 序

自新冠疫情发生以来，我的生活受到了极大的影响。从最开始的留学生活的草草结束，到后来眼睛的疾病，再到美国签证被长时间行政审查而不得不延期研究生入学。经历了接近两年的各种磨难，我慢慢的成长着。从最开始的患有急性焦虑症并因此体验了英国NHS救护车，到现在的失学失业。在这个不确定性纷杂的世界中，我似乎逐渐摸索出了与之相处的方法。

为了摆脱内心的焦灼，最初，我曾尝试禅修。但由于种种原因，似乎效果并不佳。到后来我偶然发现，观看古生物发展史的纪录片，似乎对缓解我的心理焦虑有着一定的影响，但并不显著。然而，这个契机让我开始逐渐认识的我焦虑产生的根源。那大概便是对未来不确定性的困扰以及对我应对不确定性的策略的不自信。

经过长期的探索，我发现以下几点能够显著改善我的心里状况：
 - 睡觉，自然醒
 - 重视三餐，吃自己喜欢的食物
 - 每天至少去大自然（公园，树林）带半小时
 - 10分钟以上的中度运动
 - 充实地生活


本文中，将重点阐述最后一条的具体内容和实施方法。

## 详述

**持续学习; 持续思考; 持续实践; 让一切自然而然发生。** 

这句话的意思是，不要让自己闲下来。当自己无事可做的时候，找自己当前最想做的方向或事情，比如英语或编程，然后做当前内心最倾向的流程，比如探索学习，思考整理，或者实践。让直觉来引导当前最适合做的具体事情。但在大的方向上，比如当前的工作重心应该是学英语还是练习算法，则要充分的研究规划好。

## Preface

Since the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, my life has been greatly affected. From the beginning of the study abroad life hastily ended, to later eye diseases, and then to the United States visa was subject to a long administrative review and had to postpone graduate school enrollment. After nearly two years of various hardships, I slowly grew up. From the beginning, I suffered from acute anxiety disorder and experienced the British NHS ambulance, until now I am out of school and unemployed. In this uncertain world, I seem to have gradually figured out a way to get along with it.

In order to get rid of my inner anxiety, I tried meditation at first. But due to various reasons, it seems that the effect is not good. Later, I accidentally discovered that watching a documentary on the history of paleontology seemed to have a certain effect on alleviating my psychological anxiety, but it was not significant. However, this opportunity allowed me to gradually understand the source of my anxiety. That is probably the trouble with the uncertainty of the future and the lack of confidence in my strategy to deal with the uncertainty.

After long-term exploration, I found that the following points can significantly improve my mental condition:
 -Sleep, wake up naturally
 -Pay attention to three meals and eat your favorite food
 -Go to nature (parks, woods) for at least half an hour every day
 -More than 10 minutes of moderate exercise
 -Live to the fullest


In this article, I will focus on the specific content and implementation methods of the last article.

## Detailed

**Keep learning; keep thinking; keep practicing; let everything happen naturally.**

The meaning of this sentence is, don't let yourself be idle. When you have nothing to do, look for the direction or thing you want to do most, such as English or programming, and then do the most inclined process in your heart, such as exploring and learning, thinking and organizing, or practicing. Let intuition guide the specific things that are best for doing right now. But in the general direction, such as whether the current work should focus on learning English or practicing algorithms, it is necessary to fully research and plan.
